# Soil Irrigation System with IC555, Water Level Controller with IC4093, and Power Supply using IC7805

## Introduction

Efficient soil irrigation and water level control are essential for successful agricultural practices. To achieve this, the project combines three circuits: a soil irrigation system using IC555 as an astable multivibrator, a water level controller with IC4093 as a Schmitt trigger, and a power supply circuit using IC7805. These integrated circuits work harmoniously to automate the irrigation process, manage water levels, and ensure a stable power source for the system.

## Soil Irrigation System using IC555 (Astable Multivibrator)

The soil irrigation system's core is the IC555 timer, configured as an astable multivibrator. This configuration generates a continuous square wave output, which serves as the control signal for water flow. A soil moisture sensor is incorporated into the circuit to monitor the soil's moisture content continually. When the moisture level falls below a predetermined threshold, the IC555 triggers the water pump, providing water to the soil. This automated approach optimizes water usage, prevents over-irrigation, and promotes healthier plant growth.

## Water Level Controller using IC4093 (Schmitt Trigger)

Complementing the soil irrigation system, the IC4093-based water level controller is responsible for managing the water level in the irrigation tank. The IC4093 operates as a Schmitt trigger and utilizes water level probes or sensors inside the tank. When the water level drops below a specific point, the IC4093 activates the water supply, refilling the tank. Once the water level reaches the desired threshold, the supply is cut off. This intelligent control mechanism ensures a consistent water supply, preventing water shortages during the irrigation process.

## Power Supply using IC7805

To ensure stable operation, the system incorporates an IC7805-based power supply circuit. The IC7805 is a reliable voltage regulator that converts an unregulated input voltage into a stable +5V output. This regulated voltage is crucial for powering various components of the system, including the IC555, IC4093, and other sensors. With a stable power source, the system operates efficiently and reliably, promoting consistent irrigation and water management.

## Major Circuit Integration

By combining the soil irrigation system with IC555, the water level controller with IC4093, and the power supply using IC7805, the project creates an all-in-one soil irrigation solution. The integrated system automatically regulates water flow based on soil moisture levels, manages water levels in the tank, and ensures a stable power supply. This holistic approach optimizes water consumption, increases crop yield, and simplifies the irrigation process for agricultural applications.
